I created repo as in the optional task at https://github.com/AlexandreAlberti/SandsoftTest

I liked how the default .gitignore file looked like.

I enjoyed quite a lot the test, but I'd like to say only 1 thing regarding it.

With the task link you send through email, it may be really nice to send list of software you need to have in order to not waste time installing stuff. 

I used a fresh new PC instalment I have recently bought and need to spend almost 2h preparing it, because I downloaded default Unity version, and your example was in a previous version.

Unless this is a thing you want to evaluate, the time pressure conflict resolution, it's not feeling good.

I also do not have any available Android device to test, so I had to rely on the simulator with Pixel 5. Hope that this is enough.

Thank you very much for the opportunity.

Hope to listen from you soon.

Alex.
